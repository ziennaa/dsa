/*\
Finds minimum time in which m balloons can be inflated by n assistants.

Simulates each assistantâ€™s work-rest cycle to calculate productivity in given time.

Distributes exactly m balloons among assistants based on what they could do in that time.

Handles all edge cases like: some assistants doing more than needed, rest cycles, etc.
