Prime Subarray
Given an array arr of size N, find the number of subarrays whose sum is prime.

The sum of all elements in arr <= 10^7

Note - An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.

Sample 0
Input
arr = [1, 2, 3]

Output
4

Explanation
The subarrays with sum as a prime number are [2], [3], [2,3] and [1,2].

Sample 1
Input
arr = [1]

Output
0

Explanation
There are no subarrays with sum as a prime number.*/
